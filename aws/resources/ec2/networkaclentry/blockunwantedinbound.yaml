Parameters:

  cfparamNetworkAclId:
    Type: String
  cfparamEphemeralPortStart:
    Type: String
    Default: "1024"
  
#avoid 450-499 numbers in other rulesets
#these rules block practically the entire
#internet. Add exceptions above this 
#as needed in a separate exceptions file
#so this file remains reusable.
#If you need countless exceptions, this
#file probably won't work for you.
#But then maybe you should consider 
#separate networks or VPCs to reduce the
#number of exceptions.
